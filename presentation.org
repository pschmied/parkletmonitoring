* Introduction & Research Questions
** Parklets & Streateries
- 2013, Seattle began permitting on-street parking conversion to
   public space
- Open 24/7, but often used as additional seating for adjacent
   business during business hours
- Seen as neighborhood amenity, improvement of public space
** Do parklets pose a threat to human health?
- Air quality (i.e. black carbon from vehicle emissions)
- Exposure to noise
- Comparison of adjacent indoor levels to outdoor parklet levels


* Data collection: Three Locations
- Cortona Cafe
- Montana Bar
- SIFF Theater / Uptown Espresso

INSERT MAPS OF PARKLETS HERE

* Data collection: Cortona Cafe
INSERT PICTURE
- Central District
- Typical Cafe hours
- Two lane road
- Near residential
- Was being used each visit

* Data collection: Montana Bar
INSERT PICTURE
- Capitol Hill
- Late afternoon / early evening bar crowd
- Commercial area
- Busy road, busy sidewalk, busy parklet

* Data collection: SIFF / Uptown Espresso
INSERT PICTURE
- Lower Queen Anne
- Mid-afternoon coffee / sunshine crowd
- Uptown Espresso on same block face (easier access than SIFF proper)
- On busy bus route (D-line + other routes)
- Shared with one or two other people each time

* Methodology: Sampling
** Gear
- AE51
- Decibel 10th (iPhone & iPad---uncalibrated, but same device at each
  site pair)
** Sample strategy
- 4 pairs of samples at each site
- 15 minute sample frame Decibel 10th
- 15 minute AE51 at SIFF, 30 minute black carbon at Cortona & Montana
- AE51: 150ml flow rate, 30 second interval

* Methodology: Analysis
** Data cleaning / post-processing
- Add site and indoor/outdoor fields
- Concatenate samples
- Did NOT filter extreme / negative values (more on why later)
** Exploratory data analysis 
** BEST (Kruschke 2013) for statistical comparison of indoor / outdoor samples
- One comparison per sample site (i.e. Cortona indoor vs. Cortona outdoor, etc.)
- All sample frames combined
- Bayesian posterior
