* Introduction & Research Questions
** Parklets & Streateries
- 2013, Seattle began permitting on-street parking conversion to
   public space
- Open 24/7, but often used as additional seating for adjacent
   business during business hours
- Seen as neighborhood amenity, improvement of public space
** Do parklets pose additional threat to human health?
- Air quality (i.e. black carbon from vehicle emissions)
- Exposure to noise
- Comparison of adjacent indoor levels to outdoor parklet levels

- Lower Queen Anne
- Mid-afternoon coffee / sunshine crowd
- Uptown Espresso on same block face
- On busy bus route (D-line, others)
- Shared with one or two others each time

* Methodology: Sampling
** Gear
- Aethlabs AE51
- Decibel 10th (iPhone & iPad---uncalibrated, but same device at each
  site pair)
** Sample strategy
- 4 pairs of samples at each site
- 15 minute sample frame Decibel 10th
- 15 minute AE51 at SIFF, 30 minute black carbon at Cortona & Montana
- AE51: 150ml flow rate, 30 second interval

* Black carbon sample / EDA

:END:
- Use mean DB level reported 0.1 seconds by Decibel 10th app
- Aggregate by mean in 10 second intervals
- Implications of aggregation

* Methodology: Analysis
** BEST (Kruschke 2013) to compare in-/outdoors
- One comparison per site (indoor v. outdoor)
- Bayesian posterior obtained via MCMC
- Reasonable accommodation of outliers
- Richer inference than, e.g. t-test

* Conclusions
- Black Carbon exposure site specific
- Worth noting that outdoor BC exposure higher the more commercial
  areas, but too few sites measured to make generalization.
- Preliminary results indicate noise higher indoors than outdoors,
  with exception of Cortona location, which has comparable levels
